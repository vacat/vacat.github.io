Despite facing short-term cash flow pressures and profitability challenges, the "Consumer+AI+Cloud" strategic direction is clear. The continued high-speed growth of AI products and strong cloud business performance indicate Alibaba is successfully transforming into a technology-driven internet company.

For investors, balance is needed between short-term financial metric fluctuations and long-term strategic value. Alibaba's current transformation investments may continue to impact profitability in the coming quarters, but successful execution of the AI+Cloud strategy will bring greater long-term value potential.
