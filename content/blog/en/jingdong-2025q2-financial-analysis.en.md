## Marketing Expense Surge: The Price of Price Wars

Marketing expenses surged from 11.9 billion yuan in the same period last year to **27 billion yuan**, a 127.6% increase, far exceeding revenue growth.

This figure reflects JD's massive investment in the fierce food delivery market competition, but also raises questions about return on investment.

## Significant User Growth: Traffic Dividend Emerging

The food delivery business brought significant traffic benefits to JD:
- Active user count growth exceeded **40%** YoY
- User shopping frequency also grew over 40% YoY

### Cross-selling Effect
**40% of food delivery users purchase daily necessities**, driving 16.4% revenue growth in this category, demonstrating good ecosystem synergy.

- **Q2 Free Cash Flow**: 22 billion yuan (vs 49.6 billion yuan same period last year, "halved")

### Industry Competition Landscape
> "Food delivery losses are larger than expected, short-term performance pressure is severe, and profitability needs time."
> 
> —— Securities analyst Hu Youan

**Market Share Forecast:**
- **Goldman Sachs predicts JD's food delivery market share by end of 2025**: 5%
- **JD food delivery user repurchase rate**: 28% (vs Meituan's 65%)

### Industry-wide Losses
The food delivery war has evolved into a "lose-lose-lose" situation:
- JD's new business loss: 14.7 billion yuan
- Meituan's core business profit significantly declined
- Ele.me continues to lose money

Goldman Sachs predicts the **entire industry will lose another 92 billion yuan over the next year**.

## Regulatory Intervention and Industry Changes

In July, the State Administration for Market Regulation summoned the three major platforms to stop vicious competition. After the meeting:
- All platforms reduced subsidy intensity
- JD changed "20-minute overtime free order" to "on-time guarantee compensation"

## Strategic Outlook and Investment Advice

### Management Strategic Statement
JD management stated that food delivery and instant retail are important strategic directions for the company, aiming to build a sustainable business model for five, ten, or even twenty years, rather than pursuing short-term results. The differentiation lies in the "quality food delivery" model, which will gradually release value in the future.

### Institutional Views
JPMorgan analysis suggests JD may be the first to exit the price war in Q3, while Alibaba may continue investing in food delivery business based on strategic considerations.

## Investment Key Points Summary
